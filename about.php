	  		The United States Marine Corps is a naval infantry unit that also contains combat support and combat service support units to aide in its offensive and defensive missions. The Marine Corps is a combined arms force by nature, and utilizes combined arms in warfare to put their enemy in the horns of a dilemma. Combined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms elements to acheive a complementary effect. For example, Marine Infantry and armor manuvering on an etrenched enemy as attack helicopters suppress them. For the enemy to defend against one element of the combined arms assault, would make him vulnerable to the others; putting him in the horns of a dilemma. The purpose of any such assault on a combatant or group thereove will be to fix them with a combination of fires and finish them via troops and armor on the ground or through aerial surgical strikes.

	  	<p> The United States Marine Corps organizes into combined arms units called Marine Air-Ground Task Force(s) (MAGTF). There are four different sizes of MAGTFs that can respond to the crisis level, tactical level, operational level, and the strategic level of armed conflict anywhere in the world. MAGTFs of all sizes are composed of the same parts, an aviation component, logistic component, ground component, and a command element that integrate with each other and naval vessels to form a forward deployed expeditionary force. The individual components of a MAGTF work together in order to respond to any crisis or wartime event at sea, in the air, or on land with devastating precision and controlled chaos.
