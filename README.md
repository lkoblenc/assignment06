# midterm

Leonard Koblence: IA, Coder, Designer

NOTE: Though it wasn't required I did my best to make the website friendly on differnt platforms such as tablets and mobile devices. Also I am very pleased with how the aesthetics of the website turned out. 

SMACSS was used for CSS architecture although spread out accross three CSS files 

Typography: Two fonts chosen were stencil fonts, Allerta and Stardos. These fonts were used for three reaons: 

- They Compliment each other.
- They are relevant to the content of the website. (Stencil fonts are commonly used in USMC for printings and labels per regulation)
- They help to support and convey the overall theme of the website. 

C.R.A.P. Principles: I chose the colors for text, namely green(p and banner), majenta(h2), etc. because they compliment each other well providing adequate contrast. Every object is aligned with a purpose, for example: the objects on the index page are moved to different corners and aligned to objects above them, and on the about page, the arms of the F pattern are aligned with each other. I utilized proximity by placing the USMC logo next to the h1 on the about and sign-up pages to indicate that it is a clicklable section.

Three Page Website

 - Index page utilizing a USMC camo background is arranged in a Z pattern with a button leading to the next page in the top left, text leading to wiki source in top right, slogan in dead space, and a "read more" button also for the next page. The page is organized in this way to enusre the reader is pulled in and continues on to follow on pages, as is the goal of a Z pattern. 

 - The about page is oriented into an F pattern with a repeating taxonomy of the Title to the left, image in the middle, and descriptive text on the right. There are two arms of the F on the about page going down the content which leads to some enticing text and a newsletter signup button. 

 -The sign up page contains the form element and an image to the right of the form.
